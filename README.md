check-password-strength is an open-source tool that could help you to check how your passwords are good. It reads a CSV file and assigns a score to each password within a range from 0 (worst) to 4 (best):

```bash

```

It supports CSV files from exported from the most popular Password Managers and Browsers and runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

It's based on the awesome [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) library and its Go porting [zxcvbn-go](github.com/nbutton23/zxcvbn-go).

The passwords will be checked on:
- english words and names
- italian words and names
- common used passwords
- common keyboards sequences
- l33t substitutions
- username as part of the password

## Suppoted CSV file formats

- [x] LastPass

(*) the custom CSV files must have a header with at least the following three fields: `url,username,password`
